"""Lab 1, part one: serial k-means over ``proteins.csv``.

The program reads the dataset, builds the elbow graph to choose the optimum
number of clusters, clusters the proteins by ``enzyme`` and ``hydrofob``,
reports the cluster holding the longest sequence and prints the execution
time. Every figure is built only after the clock has been stopped, so nothing
blocks while the work being measured is running.

Run it from the directory that holds ``proteins.csv``::
