"""Lab 1, part three: parallel k-means over ``proteins.csv`` with threads.

Same data-parallel (SPMD) decomposition as the multiprocessing version: the
dataset is split into one chunk per thread, every thread runs the same map
step over its own chunk, and the main thread reduces the partial results into
the new centroids. Threads share the address space, so the chunks are passed
straight to them with no copy; the speedup comes from the NumPy operations,
which release the GIL while they run.

Run it from the directory that holds ``proteins.csv``::
